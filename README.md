# Spam-Filter

In this project, I use Naïve Bayes to implement a spam filtering model. I use the dataset <b><i>spam.csv</i></b> to train and test the model.

The messages within the datasets have already been classified as ham (not spam), or spam.

The implementation of a Naïve Bayes Spam Filter is relatively straight forward using scikit-learn, however, this library hides the implementation details (and many solutions are available on the Internet). Therefore, in this project I do not use the scikit-learn library or similar libraries that perform similar tasks in order to better understand implementation details.
